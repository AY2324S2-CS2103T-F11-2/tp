## About MyBookshelf
* MyBookshelf is designed to help improve the management of public community libraries.
* It helps to keep track of book transactions within the library.
* This helps to prevent irresponsible behaviour that violates the library's borrowing guidelines, easing management duties.

## Project Details
  * The project is CLI based to make it quick to use and  easy for users who prefer typing commands over mouse operations.
  * The user can add, edit, find or delete borrowers in order to keep track of who is using their library
  * The user can also keep track of borrow and return transactions.
  * The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called AddressBook) used for managing contact details.
      * It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC), without being overwhelmingly big.
      * It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.

* Example usages:
  * Allows librarian to **add** new borrower
  * Allows librarian to **list** all borrowers
  * Allows librarian to **edit** an existing borrower
  * Allows librarian to **find** borrower whose names contain the given keywords
  * Allows librarian to **delete** an existing borrower
  * Allows librarian to create a **borrow** transaction
  * Allows librarian to create a **return** transaction
